## Course Overview

This course covers the fundamentals of ARM microcontroller architecture, programming, and interfacing. Through hands-on assignments and projects, students will gain experience with the STM32 series microcontrollers, including practical applications like GPIO control, ADC, timers, and communication protocols. Feel free to explore and use the materials in this repository to deepen your understanding of ARM microcontrollers!

## Session 1: Introduction to ARM Microcontrollers
This session provides an overview of ARM architecture and the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, covering essential features and basic setup.

## Session 2: RCC (Reset and Clock Control)
An in-depth look at the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) peripheral, including configuration of system clocks and oscillator settings to optimize performance.

## Session 3: GPIO Control and SysTick
This session covers General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) functionality, allowing students to control LEDs at the register level. Additionally, it includes work with the SysTick peripheral to enable precise time delays and system ticks.

## Session 4: EXTI and NVIC
This session explores the External Interrupt and Event Controller (EXTI) and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) peripherals. The EXTI allows external signals to trigger interrupts, and the NVIC is responsible for managing these interrupts at the processor level.

## Session 5: Timers
Timers are essential for generating precise delays, measuring time intervals, and generating PWM signals. This session introduces the STM32 timers with the focus on the Output Compare Mode.

## Session 6: ADC(Analog-to-Digital Converter)
This session covers the fundamentals of the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) peripheral, essential for reading analog signals from sensors and converting them into digital values for further processing. 
## Assignments and Projects
Detailed descriptions of each assignment and project, including setup instructions and required files.
